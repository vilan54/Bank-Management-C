# Bank-Management-C
***
## ðŸ“‘ Description
The Bank Account Management System is a console-based application developed in C, designed to simulate the basic operations of a bank account such as creating new accounts, updating existing accounts, conducting transactions (deposits and withdrawals), and viewing account details. This project emphasizes the use of file handling in C to store and manage user data persistently across sessions
***
## ðŸŒŸ Key features
* **Account Creation**: Allows users to create a new bank account by providing personal information and initial deposit amount. The system generates a unique account number for each user
* **Balance Inquiry**: Account holders can check their current account balance along with a summary of recent transactions.
* **Deposits and Withdrawals**: Enables account holders to perform financial transactions. The system updates account balances in real-time and maintains transaction logs for future reference.
* **Transactions between users**: Facilitates fund transfers between accounts. Users can initiate transactions by specifying the recipient's account number and the amount to transfer. The system verifies the availability of funds and updates both the sender's and recipient's account balances accordingly.
* **Data Persistence**: Utilizes file handling to store all account and transaction data. This ensures that information is preserved between program executions, allowing for long-term data management.

## âœ… Objective:
The objective of this project is to demonstrate practical file handling in C, emphasizing how real-world applications can manage data persistently. It provides a foundational framework for understanding how to design and implement a comprehensive banking system, showcasing key programming concepts and system design principles, including transactions between users to mimic real-world banking operations.
